 SOLVING DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS ON A COMPUTER  
This session aims to introduce you to simulating brain dynamics on a computer. The practical  
is split into three parts, which take you through the steps required to simulate cortical gamma  
oscillations using the Wilson-Cowan model. The parts are outlined below:   
1. The Euler method: You will implement a dynamical systems solver on a computer  
2. The Wilson-Cowan model: You will implement the Wilson-Cowan model + simulate using the  
Euler method, to observe the generation of gamma rhythms.  
3. Stochastic differential equations: You will learn how to add noise to dynamical systems, and  
study noise-induced gamma oscillations in your Wilson-Cowan model.
